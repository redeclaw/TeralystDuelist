  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: d9f613004b22ea84ca9ad26965ac3952, type: 2}

  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 487faee2f54d7eb46a3bfd24dec283ef, type: 2}
    Dialogue: "Pff. Yeah right. Even if I had the money to purchase tickets, there\u2019s
      no way I\u2019d buy them from some rando on the street."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: d9f613004b22ea84ca9ad26965ac3952, type: 2}

    Dialogue: "I try to turn away, but he grabs me by the shoulder, holding me in
      place. His grip is oddly firm.\r"
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 753e0d1a75d7b2d4abd02fa8c6c2bfe5, type: 2}

      We\u2019re missing a person for the undercard."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 487faee2f54d7eb46a3bfd24dec283ef, type: 2}
    Dialogue: "I didn\u2019t realize there\u2019d be a fight before the main event.
      I guess the event wouldn\u2019t last very long with just one duel. Tickets
      would be nice, but I\u2019m not looking to get beat up on live TV.\r"
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: d9f613004b22ea84ca9ad26965ac3952, type: 2}
    Dialogue: Not interested.
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 753e0d1a75d7b2d4abd02fa8c6c2bfe5, type: 2}
    Dialogue: "I\u2019ll make it worth your while. 1000 creds if you win."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: d9f613004b22ea84ca9ad26965ac3952, type: 2}
    Dialogue: "Look, I\u2019m busy tonight. The last time I played was when I was
      in high school. Go find someone else."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 753e0d1a75d7b2d4abd02fa8c6c2bfe5, type: 2}
    Dialogue: "Look, I don\u2019t care how bad of a player you are, you have a chance
      against this guy. He\u2019s an A tier idiot. I don\u2019t care how long it\u2019s
      been since you last played, if you go up there and give it your best shot,
      you\u2019ll have a solid chance at winning.\r"
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 487faee2f54d7eb46a3bfd24dec283ef, type: 2}
    Dialogue: "Okay, that\u2019s pretty bad. I haven\u2019t changed my deck at all
      since I played in high school, and I still might have a chance."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 487faee2f54d7eb46a3bfd24dec283ef, type: 2}
    Dialogue: "I haven\u2019t played in years. There\u2019s basically zero chance
      I win this. This will probably take up my entire night, and I\u2019ve got dinner
      to cook and laundry to do. If I lose, not only will I have embarrassed myself
      on live TV, but I'll also probably be up all night catching up with all the
      time I wasted.\r"
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 487faee2f54d7eb46a3bfd24dec283ef, type: 2}
    Dialogue: "But for some reason, I feel like I can believe Telin. 1000 creds is
      some good money. That\u2019s a month\u2019s worth of pay right there. If I
      do manage to win this, it\u2019d be totally worth it. And even if I lose, I
      guess tickets would be kinda nice.\r"
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: d9f613004b22ea84ca9ad26965ac3952, type: 2}
    Dialogue: " \u2026 Alright. I\u2019m in."
  - speaker: {fileID: 11400000, guid: 753e0d1a75d7b2d4abd02fa8c6c2bfe5, type: 2}
    Dialogue: "Glad to hear it. Follow me, I\u2019ll take you to the place."
